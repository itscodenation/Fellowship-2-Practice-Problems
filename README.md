# 3.7 Guided Practice

1. The goal of this guided practice is to use the Array.map() function to create React components.  

2. The training wheels are off for this one!  In the data.js file, you'll find an array containing information for instagram posts.  Each "post" contains an image, and then a list of comments.  Each "comment" object contains a "user" and a "comment".

3. You will need to create two new components from scratch: a "Post" component, and a "Comment" component to display the data from data.js.  It should look like a cheap instagram clone.  Check out this image from my solution.

4.  Here's what my solution looks like (https://imgur.com/a/9XmKWs3).  

5.  This will be tricky!  You'll be working mostly independently, and will have to debug on your own.  Make sure to start with a working page, add a small change, SAVE, and check if your change worked.  Finding an error after a small change is MUCH easier than after a large change.
